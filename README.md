# HTTPREPL.jl
Evaluate Julia Code on a remote REPL over HTTP.

This package is in an early development stage. There is an other Julia package, named (RemoteREPL.jl)[https://github.com/JuliaWeb/RemoteREPL.jl], which likely works better in most cases.

## Install

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/baxmittens/HTTPREPL.jl.git")
```

## Usage

I will briefly describe my use-case here. Other applications are possible; the code may have to be extended for this. This should be relatively easy.

Setting:

Worker A: my local desktop with display and GPU.

Worker B: compute server without display, GPU, X11, or else.

Worker A:
```julia
using HTTPREPL
HTTPREPL.setup!(ip="ip of worker A", port=1234, pw="test1234!")
HTTPREPL.listen()
```

Worker B:
```julia
using HTTPREPL
HTTPREPL.setup!(ip="ip of worker A", port=1234, pw="test1234!")

x = 0:.1:2Ï€
y = sin.(x)

@rREPL begin
    using CairoMakie
    f = Figure();
    ax = Axis(f[1,1])
    lines!(ax, $x, $y)
    display(f)
end
```

Result: Plot appears on worker A.

## Safety warning

By `HTTPREPL.listen()` you allow for the execution of code over HTTP, which could be very dangerous. It is not recommended to listen to IPs which are publicly available. Best way to use this package is either in a closed network or to use it together with port forwarding via `ssh -L 1234:localhost:1234 username@server`.
